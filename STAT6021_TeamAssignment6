## Question 1: ##
#################

# For each part of this problem, you are to create (or find) a data set with about 30 observations 
# that is suitable for simple linear regression and satisfies the given specifications. If it is 
# not possible, explain why it is not possible. For each part, include a plot that shows the 
# interesting points.
#
#   (a) The data set has a point that is identified by all of the leverage and influential point
#       diagnostics -- hat matrix diagonal, Cook's D, DFBETAS, and DFFITS.
#   (b) The data set has a point that is identified by Cook's D but not by DFBETAS.
#   (c) The data set has a point that is identified by DFBETAS but not by Cook's D.
#   (d) The data set has a point that is identified by DFBETAS but not by DFFITS.
#   (e) The data set has a point that is identified by DFBETAS and DFFITS but not by the hat matrix
#       diagonal.
#   (f) The data set has a point that is identified by the hat matrix diagonal and DFFITS but not 
#       by Cook's D.

## Question 2: ##
#################

# For each part of this problem, you are to create (or find) a data set with about 30 observations 
# that has a nonlinear relationship, but is suitable for simple linear regression with some 
# modifications and satisfies the given specifications. For each part, include at least a scatterplot 
# of the data and explain your criteria for assessing performance.
#
#   (a) The linear model using a transformed explanatory variable outperforms the model using the
#       quadratric term of the explanatory variable.
#   (b) The linear model using the quadratric term of the explanatory variable outperforms the model 
#       using a transformed explanatory variable.
#   (c) The linear model using a transformed explanatory variable and the model using the quadratric 
#       term of the explanatory variable perform equally well.

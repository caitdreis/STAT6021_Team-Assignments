## Question 1: ##
#################

# For each part of this problem, you are to create (or find) a data set with about 30 observations 
# that is suitable for simple linear regression and satisfies the given specifications on the variance
# of the residuals. For each part, include a plot of your residuals that shows the required characteristic.
#
#   (a) The residuals have constant variance.
#   (b) The residuals have variance proportional to E(y).
#   (c) The residuals have variance proportional to E(y)^2.
#   (d) The residuals have variance proportional to 1/E(y).

data <- read_csv("stat4.csv")

lm <- lm(y~x, data=data) #Run the linear regression

# generate predictions

Predicted_values = predict(lm, newdata = data)

# calculate the residuals
library("MASS") #need this package to calculate the studentized residual with studres()
studentized <- studres(lm); studentized #Find the studentized residuals
rstudent <-rstudent(lm); rstudent #Find the R-student residuals
standardized = rstandard(lm); standardized #Find the standardized residuals

# press residual
(r <- resid(lm))
(pr <- resid(lm)/(1 - lm.influence(lm)$hat))
sum(r^2)
press<- sum(pr^2) #PRESS residual is 321.22


# estimate against predicted values

plot(Predicted_values, standardized)# 1/E(y) type of relationship
plot(Predicted_values, studentized) # 1/E(y) type of relationship
plot(Predicted_values, rstudent) # 1/E(y) type of relationship
plot(Predicted_values, pr) # 1/E(y) type of relationship



#   (e) The residuals have variance proportional to C-E(y) for some constant C.

#   (f) The residuals have variance proportional to E(y)(C-E(y)) for some constant C.

## Question 2: ##
#################

# For each part of this problem do the following: 
#   (1) Use the data set you created or found for Problem 1 and run three separate regression models - ordinary 
#       least squares, transformed ordinary least squares, and weighted least squares.
#       (Depending on your data, you may need to estimate the weights for the weighted least squares. These can 
#        be found by using the predicted values (squared) of a regression model that uses the fitted values as the 
#        explanatory variable and the absolute residuals as the response variable.)
#   (2) Compare the results of the three models and indicate which seems to be the best model. 
# For each part, include at least three residual plot with at least one from each model.
#
#   (a) The residuals have variance proportional to E(y).
#   (b) The residuals have variance proportional to E(y)^2.
#   (c) The residuals have variance proportional to 1/E(y).

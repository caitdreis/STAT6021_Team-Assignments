## Question 1: ##
#################

# For each part of this problem, you are to create (or find) a data set with about 30 observations 
# that is suitable for simple linear regression and satisfies the given specifications on the variance
# of the residuals. For each part, include a plot of your residuals that shows the required characteristic.
#
#   (a) The residuals have constant variance.
#   (b) The residuals have variance proportional to E(y).
#   (c) The residuals have variance proportional to E(y)^2.
#   (d) The residuals have variance proportional to 1/E(y).
#   (e) The residuals have variance proportional to C-E(y) for some constant C.
#   (f) The residuals have variance proportional to E(y)(C-E(y)) for some constant C.



#################
## Question 2: ##
#################

# For each part of this problem do the following: 
#   (1) Use the data set you created or found for Problem 1 and run three separate regression models - ordinary 
#       least squares, transformed ordinary least squares, and weighted least squares.
#       (Depending on your data, you may need to estimate the weights for the weighted least squares. These can 
#        be found by using the predicted values (squared) of a regression model that uses the fitted values as the 
#        explanatory variable and the absolute residuals as the response variable.)
#   (2) Compare the results of the three models and indicate which seems to be the best model. 
# For each part, include at least three residual plot with at least one from each model.
#
#   (a) The residuals have variance proportional to E(y).
#   (b) The residuals have variance proportional to E(y)^2.
#   (c) The residuals have variance proportional to 1/E(y).

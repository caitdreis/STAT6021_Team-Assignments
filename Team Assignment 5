## Question 1: ##
#################

# For each part of this problem, you are to create (or find) a data set with about 30 observations 
# that is suitable for simple linear regression and satisfies the given specifications on the variance
# of the residuals. For each part, include a plot of your residuals that shows the required characteristic.
#

set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(30)
#   (a) The residuals have constant variance.

y <- rnorm(30)
plot(x, y)

lm <- lm(y ~ x)
summary(lm)
qqnorm(residuals(lm))
qqline(residuals(lm))
plot(predict(lm), residuals(lm))

#   (b) The residuals have variance proportional to E(y).

y <- rnorm(30, mean = 0, sd = x^2)
plot(x, y)

lm <- lm(y ~ x)
summary(lm)
qqnorm(residuals(lm))
qqline(residuals(lm))
plot(predict(lm), residuals(lm))

#   (c) The residuals have variance proportional to E(y)^2.

y <- rnorm(30, mean = 0, sd = x^4)
plot(x, y)

lm <- lm(y ~ x)
summary(lm)
qqnorm(residuals(lm))
qqline(residuals(lm))
plot(predict(lm), residuals(lm))

#   (d) The residuals have variance proportional to 1/E(y). 

data <- read_csv("stat4.csv")

# generate predictions

plot(Predicted_values, rstudent) # 1/E(y) type of relationship

#   (e) The residuals have variance proportional to C-E(y) for some constant C.

#   (f) The residuals have variance proportional to E(y)(C-E(y)) for some constant C.

## Question 2: ##
#################

# For each part of this problem do the following: 
#   (1) Use the data set you created or found for Problem 1 and run three separate regression models - ordinary 
#       least squares, transformed ordinary least squares, and weighted least squares.
#       (Depending on your data, you may need to estimate the weights for the weighted least squares. These can 
#        be found by using the predicted values (squared) of a regression model that uses the fitted values as the 
#        explanatory variable and the absolute residuals as the response variable.)
#   (2) Compare the results of the three models and indicate which seems to be the best model. 
# For each part, include at least three residual plot with at least one from each model.
#
#   (a) The residuals have variance proportional to E(y). #dataset B from above

#   (b) The residuals have variance proportional to E(y)^2. #dataset C from above

#   (c) The residuals have variance proportional to 1/E(y). #dataset D from above
